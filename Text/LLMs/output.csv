can understand why many seem to hate this br br this movie ties together many of the overlapping settings of the historical and biblical epics of the fifties using set pieces props and costumes similar to those seen in other movies here however the story attempts to run through all of human history with frame story about the human race being on trial with guilty verdict meaning bombs will go off all over the world the prosecutor is the devil played with fiendish glee by vincent price ok so it little hokey calling the defender the spirit of all men but think that one of the things that gives this movie sense of period charm the spririt of man is incidentally played quite well by ronald coleman in his last film it is also the last movie in which groucho harpo and chico marx all appear but not together groucho plays peiter minuet buying manhattan from the indians in scene played purely for campy humor chico isn funny at all as monk who thinks the world is flat and harpo we are told is meant to be isaac newton discovering gravity most of the other performances are well done though br br other hokey things are that the trial is supposedly taking place in outer space which is depicted as region of clouds and blueness there is something called the great clock of outer space which when striking midnight may signal the end of the world br br but at its heart the movie addresses the problems of wmds and the eternal question of whether man is basically good or basically evil and poses it in what think is an interesting way also anyone who likes the look of costume epics of the fifties should like the look of this movie,1
here we go another pop star breaking in to the grand tv land and from my observations from her pop careers directors saying yeah your great gwen you could be real star maybe some day you ll be in the list movies they would do anything to expand the show there just not pretty face but have an acting ability as well almost overnight gwen has some how found the ability to act by watching actors like james dean or clint eastward please give the real people in the world that have to sit behind that box and have to suffer pop stars effort in trying to act please gwen stick to your pretty pop videos with your jap posse and don insult the british with your efforts as an actress anyway going back to my working class job and think to myself god could do that but yeah remember ll be working till 65 if live that long and yeah you put your feet up girl with your royalties every three months pah marry into money right xxx,0
the intention the directors has for this films are quite honorable but his history of his productions did get me aware that this might not get much to the core like other film makers would do it keeping his great 30 days tv series in mind but also counting in his mtv production bet you will that opposes his seriousness in any of the matters he documents and also counting in his rather disappointing production supersize me did not had my hopes up high sadly enough this movie disappointed me none the less as with supersize me after while did ask myself what exactly the point of all this was the main statement gets clear enough after half an hour but the rest of the playtime gets filled with rather pointless stuff and re repeating stuff that were already shown in this way or another earlier in the movie so it wears out and gets extremely boring towards the end,0
young warriors 1983 br br while this is deeply flawed and in some ways idiotic movie the way it continually defies expectations makes it decent viewing for the adventurous sleaze fan br br meet yuppie college student kevin and his gang of lovable frat boy buddies in what starts out as particularly egregious teen sex comedy we follow this bunch of jerk offs and their antics which involve among other things making pledges tie bricks to their genitals the movie abruptly shifts gears when kevin high school freshman sister is brutally raped and beaten into coma by gang of bikers who apparently have nothing better to do when she dies in the hospital kevin vows revenge much to the chagrin of his detective father br br so far we ve gone from porky lite through last house on the left territory into what is apparently shaping up to be your typical urban vigilante revenge flick however kevin and his gang portrayal goes from vaguely sympathetic until they become kill crazed lunatics it to the film credit that it glamorize the fascist anti crime rhetoric that kevin continually spouts while still making it understandable that he would feel the way he does br br the mood goes from lighthearted to grimy and downbeat very quickly and by the end it so over the top and exploitative that it ll leave you incredulous and that the strength of this film you never know what to expect next br br at over 100 minutes it little lengthy for this kind of fare but you won get bored poorly acted for the most part with cardboard cutouts for characters and some particularly ludicrous situations and rather stupid dialogue this won be topping anyone list of forgotten classics anytime soon got kick out of it though and sure anyone reading this knows if they re up for it,1
this movie is another on the list that did not want to see was talked into it and dragged into the theater but boy am glad for that thought it was going to be just another love story but it turns out to be sooo much more than that definatly an intellectual flick one of those movies you have to pay attention to,1
this movie is hilarious the laughs never stop every scene is packed to the limit with hilarious comedy chris farley is comic genius and spade plays his character to tee farley was one of the best slap stick comics ever and in this movie as with all his movies we see how much time and energy he devoted to portraying his character the way he saw fit tommy boy is an excellent example of comedy it always makes me laugh no matter how many times have seen it before,1
ah mcbain the character name is immortalized and forever ridiculed by the simpsons but it will also always to me personally at least remain the name and title of tremendously entertaining and outrageously violent early 90 action flick directed by the cool dude who brought us the exterminator and starring two of the most ultimately badass movie heroes christopher walken and michael ironside the latter with cute little macho ponytail guess mcbain will largely have to be labeled as guilty pleasure because there no way can convince anyone this is an intellectual motion picture the film is unimaginably preposterous most action heroes take on small gangster posse mcbain takes on an entire country and yet takes itself way too seriously the script is non stop and incoherent spitfire of clich√©d situations nonsensical twists compulsory sentimental interludes grotesquely staged action sequences and utterly implausible character drawings it totally delirious movie loved it br br vietnam pow mcbain life is saved by fellow soldier roberto santos on the very last day of the war they each keep half dollar note as symbol that mcbain is in santos debt eighteen years later santos is spirited rebel leading the revolution against the corrupt president of his home country columbia santos initial attempt to take over the power fails and he publicly executed on el presidente balcony his sister travels to new york with the dollar note and turns to mcbain for financial assistance and manpower mcbain and his former vietnam buddies who all coincidentally happen to be fed up with the injustice in this world charter themselves miserable little plane and fly to columbia to open gigantic can of whoop ass br br okay let not fool each other here the fact you re reading user comment on mcbain already indicates that you have some sort of interest for low budget movie action one of my fellow reviewers spent quite some time composing list containing all the main stupidities and insensible moments of mcbain this list is totally accurate and can only concur with it heck could even add some more senseless sequences to that list like the preposterous and needless heroic self sacrifice of soldier who doesn even have any affinity with the goal of the mission and the rest of mcbain squad but what the point you definitely know not to expect 100 coherent and plausible masterpiece we know from beforehand this will be silly and exaggeratedly flamboyant movie and it maybe even the exact reason why we want to check it out this is terrifically outrageous and exciting movie about bunch of former vietnam buddies turning into mercenaries and declaring war against the corrupt columbian president and the national drug cartel please don expect another apocalypse now this particular motion picture relies on the ruff tuff acting performances of the macho leads whole lot of explosions and gunfights and last but not least fantastic soundtrack in which joan baez sings cover of brothers in arms,1
first saw this film in the mid 60 when was teenager and it moved me so much in fact the end scene where han suyin hears of mark death and then rushes to the hill in disbelief where you then hear mark voice saying give me your hand and then the image of him disappears the butterfly with it superstitious meaning the music the shattered emotions of love of han suyin just left me sobbing my heart out was outwardly crying bitterly my mother and sister looked up and were shocked at my reaction just left the room to be on my own fortunately do not react like that any more but always cry at the end love everything about the film the music mostly the costumes of han suyin and location the beauty of jennifer jones and the handsome william holden they were both at their best have the vhs and dvd of this wonderful movie also have two versions of the music lyrics by arthur newman and sammy fain also have the book many splendored thing by han suyin recommend this film 100,1
batman returns is to be considered quality when one speaks of superhero films its predecessor batman in my opinion is by far the greatest and most well thought out of the comic book genre for one to say that batman returns was disappointing he or she has not fully watched the movie and considered the acting of danny devito as the penguin devito and walken offer some memorable moments the tale of batman is suppose to be dark and tim burton has fulfilled how the comic portrays batman batman returns provides comic relief action suspense and fantasy and it should not be viewed as crap although we are all entitled to our own opinions,1
this night listener is better than people are generally saying it has weaknesses and it seems to be having genre identity crisis no doubt but think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this the whole thing feels like one of those fireside this happened to friend of friend of mine ghost stories one big complaint about the movie is the pacing but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility and real life just sort of plods along no so there are no flashy endings or earth shattering revelations no showdown scenes thank heaven you have to get into the zone when watching this movie forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes conventionally good movie williams isn terrific but he easily meets the needs of the story plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic no one as he is the everyman the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story toni collette performance should be nominated for an oscar even if she maybe shouldn win it give it shot for quality and content alone the night listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days,1
like too many recent british films this one takes great cast and gives them flimsy cliched script to work with the performances save it from total disgrace and it has some charm but it certainly didn make me laugh where are all the great british writers hiding,0
this 1950 howler is so bad it unintentionally funny tom conway portrays dr gerard scientist who is turning natives into monster using voodoo his poor wife played by mary ellen kay is being held captive by her wacko hubby who has no time for her but threatens to kill her if she leaves him along comes marla english as greedy murderess who has already killed man to find treasure in the jungle her idiot boyfriend portrayed by lance fuller is along on the safari they hire touch connors later renamed mike connors of mannix fame as guide english is terrible actress but hey no one else in the cast were turning in academy award winning performances either touch sorry can even type the name without cracking up mean what the gave the only half way decent performance of the bunch and that saying lot the monster is only seen briefly and the ending is predictable to say the least would say this movie falls into the it so bad it almost good category of movies it good on rainy night when nothing else is on the tube,0
this is one of the greatest documentaries ve ever seen along with dark days have skated for maybe an hour my entire life and still love this movie peralta and his excellent editor captured the feeling and atmosphere perfectly helped in part with some incredible archival footage tony alva is one of the coolest individuals in existence love those knee high striped sport socks you rock tony br br not only is this movie visual feast but the soundtrack has to be one of the best in history if you re into 70 rock buy the dvd you won regret it,1
luchino visconti was and is one of the most influential cultural figures of his generation but adam low the director of this thing allows the stronger voice to be helmut berger how can it be what missed opportunity we come out of this ordeal knowing less of what made the master great and more about the things one shouldn care at all the beautiful images belong to visconti world the embarrassing interviews to the likes of berger and zeffirelli to adam low tiny little world must to avoid,0
ok italian but there aren so many italian film like this think that the plot is very good for 3 4 of the film but the final is too simple too predictable but it the only little mistake the consequences of love in my opinion have great sequences in particular at the beginning and great soundtrack like very much the lighting work on it the best thing on it is great great actor you know if your name were al pacino now everybody would have still been talking about this performance but it only great theater italian actor called toni servillo yes someone tell me this film and this kind of performance it too slow it so boring so many silences but think that this components its fantastic its the right way for describing the love story between very talented young girl the grand daughter of the italian actress anna magnani olivia and the old mysterious man toni one of my favorite italian films,1
was in my early 20 just graduating from college when this movie appeared seeing it was event of great impact not only because of the high quality of the film as evidenced by its many awards but because of its place in the historical context of 1959 because of social progress since then it is nearly impossible to fathom that my college had only begun admitting carefully screened black students in 1953 mainstream high budget extravaganze with an almost entirely black cast was distinct novelty in 1959 br br the movie was given deluxe roadshow reserved seat presentation in only the best theatres complete with souvenir program detailing the lavish care that had been taken with lighting and color multi track stereo sound etc almost every black entertainer that we white people had any knowledge of was in the movie gershwin music superbly performed and the sheer universal humanity of the story was tremendously moving br br was recently able to obtain faded copy of two hour cutting of the film and repeated viewings have confirmed my opinion time has made what seemed steamy sex scenes in 1959 seem quite tame but the musical quality has not diminished sammy davis and pearl bailey are masterful in their portrayals what crime that the young black artists of today are unable to see these performers at the peak of their careers,1
the john goodman program was pretty awful but this thing just plain stinks the one and only thing in this mess that made me smile was recognizing the voice of patrick starfish as frosty the story is hopeless written by somebody who has garbled memories of childhood rebelliousness but has never gained any adult sense of perspective in the intervening years paranoia rules the dark world that these characters inhabit everybody is unpleasant and for no reason the plot is predictable but the show lurches from one inexplicable unconnected scene to another in such pointless way there is no fun in watching it the worst thing is nobody in the production crew seems to have ever seen snow,0
the first time saw this film wanted to like it for so many reasons but simply did not it just seemed little dull but there was tiny question had about something saw near the beginning of the film so watched it again and then finally it clicked for me first watched the movie knowing the surprise ending and while definitely wouldn recommend having the ending spoiled for you have still thoroughly enjoyed the bulk of the film and discovering the many seemingly insignificant events that all unravel to point to very sinister scheme br br don think that everyone will love this movie or even like it if you like any of the actors you ll like this movie because the acting is fairly strong and they all get lot of screen time if you like mysteries namely hitchcock you ll like this movie if you like independent or psychological films you ll like this movie it really worked for me on all of those levels if you don like the actors mysterious plots or psychological elements you might not like this movie but that your loss personally the only thing that irked me little was the accents good try alan rickman on the american dialect but it wasn much improvement from the scene in die hard the wonderful voice makes up for the weird accent though the medley of accents in the movie was little odd but it was not so distracting that it became difficult or particularly irritating also the camera change from scene to scene was evident and might bother some people but actually think it added to the scenes or scene can really only recall one scene where the change was severely different but it worked br br when you see this movie see it at least twice the second time you see it hope you realize how intricate the plot really is every time watch this movie it under an hour and half so multiple viewings are not difficult seem to notice something else about it and find myself wondering why did that just happen or was that intentional like movies that make me think this one does so just see it twice,1
an epic story of hope constrained by budget and limited artistic ambition seeing as terrence malick produced this expected something haunting and lyrical instead we get typical norwegian co production revolution with al pacino anyone where quite possibly good intentions are scuppered by dreadful screenplay and where many of the characters are reduced to stereotypes the me tarzan you jane english dialogue between the non english speaking protagonists is particularly cringeworthy one could speculate whether nick nolte and tim roth ad libbed their own as they almost sound like real people the story is loaded with implausibility we are expected to believe that binh can speak smattering of english after having spent his entire life living as peasant slave his vocabulary but unfortunately not grammatical command increases impressively in the malayan refugee camp without the benefit of night classes coincidence is rife wonder whether an hour or two has been edited from the first third he tracks down his mother in ho chi minh city almost immediately after bumping into his thirty year younger half brother who nonchalantly recognises him mum gives him gold locket or something similar of great value as they part but this is never referred to again his relationship with me dead inside ling is supposed to provide the obligatory love interest but feels as artificial as leonardo and cameron in gangs of new york br br the voyage in the rust bucket of boat does convey sense of the appalling conditions that human trafficking entails indeed the only time the film is remotely exciting and unpredictable is the jerky hand held footage shot from the bridge during choppy weather conditions incidentally boat cruise from malaysia to new york via the cape of good hope and the african coast without stopping for fuel or supplies is certainly an epic journey the beautiful shot of the new york skyline echoes malick use of magic hour but want to know why the coast guard didn show up perhaps they were watching the super bowl or something of course binh manages to track down his blind old dad on remote farm in texas with the same navigational flair he displayed in ho chi minh city was impressed at how nick nolte could wander around digging fields and feeding horses on large ranch without the aid of guide dog or white stick for demonstration of how story about the travails befalling refugees could be structured and shot on small budget check out michael winterbottom far superior in this world,0
jesse yet again delivers after almost 12 months of hype about his upcoming production it finally reaches the dark world of the internet with more than brilliant approach to amateur film making br br dbp is original nail biting commentary on troubled child growing into an even more troubled adult if had more than two thumbs would give more but think two will be enough br br great work from all cast especially by marissa and elizabeth the character of emily as an adult has given me shivers so far and afraid of where she ll go next br br an excellent watch,1
have three comments to make about this film which discovered hanging out forlornly in lower shelf at blockbuster first off it is interesting to see the approaches film makers take in trying to film essentially unfilmable works some have as kubrick did with lolita gotten the original author to write screenplay that is something like the original work of course that can happen here kraft ebing is long dead some have used the premises of the original work as launch point to go in completely new unrelated direction the recent adaptation of tristram shandy comes to mind here you can dumb it down the film of slaughterhouse five is to my mind an example of that or you can simply take the format of the original and try to render it in cinematic vignettes that would be the approach of woody allen everything you wanted to know about sex and arguably this film upon consideration it is probably the only thing one can do with scholarly work like psychopathia sexualis the potential loss is that whatever cumulative point the original work had is obscured or destroyed and so it is here br br point two is the cinematic style some would call it an homage to murnau pabst carl dreyer etc but think it more crude than that its far too heavy handed and self conscious to be effective for long it is eventually just annoying br br point three is perhaps less intellectual observation how did the people responsible for this manage to make film about wild sexual deviations and perversion that is so incredibly boring found the film impossible to pay attention to and anyone who is not automatically drawn to depictions of sexual deviance will find it so as well don want to be completely uncharitable and say the film is pointless but have to say that whatever point the film makers had is rather obscured by the nature of the source material the overt copying of filmic styles and the stubborn refusal to engage the audience on an emotional level possibly for fear of being accused of titillation br br the film is dubious exercise from the start and doesn really work for me sorry to say,0
you can help but marvel at hitchcock early work saboteur for example is so slick and quick that it hard to believe he made this film over 60 years ago there some propaganda elements but they re woven into the mystery so well that the thing plays beautifully years later you also get some previews of stuff that hitchcock would do later like using national landmark as backdrop this time it the statue of liberty in north by northwest of course it mt rushmore you ll also recognize things that pop up later in rear window and vertigo in saboteur but let not give away the show robert cummings is excellent as is the oh so charming otto kruger look for hitchcock mini western in this one it happens quickly so don blink,1
utter dreck got to the 16 minute 27 second point and gave up have given it negative number review if that were possible although pissible is more fitting word unlike the sizzle you could see and practically feel between macmurray and stanwyck in the original the chemistry between dumb ol dicky crenna and whats her face here is just non existent the anklet becomes an unattractive chunky bracelet there no ciggy lighting by fingertip and thought be sick when they have mortified looking and rightly so believe you me lee cobb as keyes practically burping upchucking his way through the explanation of his little man to mr garloupis no offence to the non sighted but it looks as though posse of blind men ran amuck with the set design of both the dietrichson and neff houses the same goes for those horrid plaid pants that phyllis wears and crikey how much does neff make that he lives overlooking huge marina this folks again all takes place in the first 16 and half minutes if you can get through more of it you have much stronger constitution than me or you are masochist but please take some alka seltzer first or you will develop little man of your own that may never go away proceed with caution obviously,0
there are lot of people that put down on these type 80 movies but those people may not have been coming of age during this time was just starting college when this movie was released so could really appreciate it at the time and my friends and still to this day will occasionally joke about certain lines in the movie as much as liked sean penn character jeff spicoli in fast times actually enjoy chris penn character tommy more because he is the lead character with more of actual speaking roll opposed to just series of one liners such as with spicoli chris penn should probably pop this film in his vcr and use it for motivation to lose some weight yes the subplot with the randy quaid vietnam vet character does seem little out of place but he does convincing job in the role if there is anyone out there that seen this movie but liked the other similar type movies such as fast times etc highly recommend it,1
what can you say about short little film filled with secondary actors and no stars with absolutely no bad performances not one poorly delivered line of dialog and with the cold violence on one hand being balanced by the warm heart of the protagonists in the story br br it jewel diamond little valuable gem of western that evokes the spirit and legend of the american west west not settled by grand heroes like hickock or cody or masterson or earp but by the spread of the everyday man and woman farmers and ranch hands merchants and miners and lumbermen whores and barkeeps and entertainers of the day some looking for riches some for peace and quiet some for religious freedom br br it is perhaps very spiritual story though not promoting any particular religion for even the non mormon cowboys portrayed by ben johnson and harry carey jr act in kind and noble ways toward everybody in the story regardless of religious affiliation and beliefs and go out of their way to promote tolerance and charity when the wagon train comes upon the stranded medicine show people and in true biblical fashion like david and goliath or samson and the philistines they are the guardian angels sent to the wagon train who eventually have to go head to head with the evil incarnate clegg clan likening them to the serpent in the garden of eden and regretting what it is they have to do afterward it sweet folkloric tale of the west that hits every target john ford takes aim at br br nowadays have western santa claus whose red outfit is covered with denim drover coat whose red stocking cap is replaced by brown stetson who carries burlap bag of presents and coil of rope to my santa added winchester rifle with sling to put on one of his shoulders and colt revolver to tuck into his waistband when people at the office ask why my santa has to carry guns simply reply snakes after all isn the spirit of the christmas season one where everybody should get what they deserve br br fifty five years later especially post 911 the philosophies and attributes demonstrated by the characters and story of this movie are still as relevant today as they were back then,1
saw this series when was kid and loved the detail it went into and never forgot it finally purchased the dvd collection and its just how remembered this is just how doco should be unbiased and factual the film footage is unbelievable and the interviews are fantastic the only other series that have found equal to this is die deutschen panzer br br only wish hollywood would sit down and watch this series then they might make some great war movies br br note band of brothers saving private ryan letters from iwo jima flags of our fathers and when trumpets fade are some recommend,1
both robert duvall and glenn close played their roles with such believability simply cried glenn close role as ruth showed her wanting to deal with the situation but she was under the domination of her husband let him think about what he did robert duvall character joe said staunchly the story depicted rural family dealing with an accidental death of son by his brother called the stone boy meaning he was so distraught and overwhelmed by what he did he became emotionally paralyzed then towards the end when jason presson character arnold let it all out to stranger was so broken hearted for him that actually thought of some of the terrible things that did in my life personalized and identified with his character frederick forrest and gail youngs roles did not add not much to the film thought of frederick forrest who played ruth antagonistic womanizing brother andy as jerk who did nothing to try to help the situation his wife lou played by gail youngs acted like crazy lady smacking arnold around out of frustration with her own problems without pity and blaming him for her troubles could not really feel sorry for these two though lou tried to keep her marriage together she was unsuccessful both did not deal with their problems effectively they really did nothing for the film and were totally ridiculous wilfred brimley minor role as the grandfather was touching for he was the only character that showed arnold any attention felt his role should have been elaborated the players were just doing what they felt was adequate and sufficient however really liked the ending so much actually smiled and cried tears of joy felt good the hillermans were family again actually wanted to be part of this family they were so realistic,1
the canterville ghost 1996 the director made this too sappy production maybe it the generation but really liked the charles laughton version there is time and place for emoting and this production does not translate very well patrick stewart reciting shakespeare was very good but still inappropriate would neither recommend nor watch again the close ups and padded text and sub plots were lost on me adding extraneous material and scenes takes away from truly great work the screenplay writer should find another profession in which to misplace his talent maybe afternoon soap operas would be better venue check out the really good version and pass on this one,0
you have to figure that when the star name is listed wrong in the opening credits you are not in for good time the credit reads cuba gooding some nice car chase shoot em up blow em up action if all you want is action because the relationship to what plot exists is tenuous at best and completely unbelievable the motivations of the characters especially that of gooding at the end are worse then unbelievable they are irrational when they are not hopelessly muddled all can think is that andy cheng must be really nice guy to get this many good actors into this foul project he can have something on all of them can he,0
james cagney racketeer and political ward heeler get to become deputy commissioner of corrections and visits boys reform school the catch is that cagney is not in it for the graft he genuinely wants to make difference in the lives of the kids there because he comes from background like their br br the villain of the piece is dudley digges who is grafting chiseler and sanctimonious hypocrite to boot one of the subtexts of the plot of the mayor of hell is that these kids are mostly immigrants and those that judge them and are in positions of power are those who are here few generations note in the mess hall scene as digges offers prayer of thanks for the food they are about to receive digges is eating well but the kids are getting quality you feed to your pet br br cagney has his own troubles back in the city with some of his henchmen and he has to take it on the lam that puts digges back in charge and setting up the film for it climax br br the mayor of hell was typical product from the working class studio and because it was pre code it gets pretty gruesome at times later version of this crime school with humphrey bogart and the dead end kids was more sanitized remake br br although cagney is fine in the lead role as is madge evans the school nurse the acting honors go to dudley digges hard to believe that the same man could portray the drunken but kindly one legged ship surgeon in mutiny on the bounty but digges is fine player and joy to watch in every film he in br br this film is not shown to often because of the racial and ethnic stereotypes it portrays whole lot of minorities would be offended today still it fine film br br interestingly enough few years ago the film sleepers came out and it touched on some of the same issues guess films about reform schools don change in any time,1
the other reviewers are way waaaay off as to why the farscape show has been temporarily put to rest it has nothing to do with the quality of the shows slacking in fact the exact opposite is true they kept getting better and better have seen every episode and when you simply watch them in order you really become in awe how much cooler it gets as they move on and on and the wormhole aeryn subplots are really very interesting and gave it more vibe not less before it was sort of chaotic slow and rather aimless they spent like the first two seasons running from this foe type but in the second two they were actually trying to do something also have never seen such great fun blend of sexy gals and attitudes in sci fi the blue girl zahn was cool but not sexy they literally got to the point where the gals were running around in leather corsets and high heels blasting aliens now tell me what could be cooler than that br br the real reason farscape went off for bit is because it was costing too much and that is good thing for the fans because the show watched end to end is really like 60 hour long epic movie with all the cinematics of the blockbuster stuff ok ok they do use similar sets lot but the cg is great and the gals are sexxxy br br blah blah the real reason is because tv shows are about profit it is business and the sci fi channel or whoever was not getting as big return on this expensive farscape show as they could with junk shows like stargate lexx was actually cool until they got rid of the hot german girl and replaced her with this bizarre fat lipped oddity br br anyway yes remember this farscape kept getting better and better until it was really like little real movie each week then the networks decided hey people will watch any old piece of drek we shove on the air as long as it is the only sci fi thing on at that hour so why are we spending all this money on farscape let shove cheesy low budget stargate down people throats and call it hit series because it like all we play every darn night lol br br that the way it goes also gotta tell ya that claudia black is really cool actress after she got her facelift got the baggy eyes tightened she was looking really cool one of those dynamic types like judy davis and sometimes hot looking sometimes ugly like roller coaster ride par claudia black with lucy lawless in style and substance both very fun to watch not just chrichton and yeah you may say the pregnancy thing was cheesy but how many sci fi shows have believable and deep romantic subplot that actually goes somewhere and progresses it was legitimately cool as romance story the actors on the show are great it really is shame the show is in limbo for now but hope it comes back in more episodes soon and movies as well because will deffinately buy them,1
beyond the fact crazy people exist and there are religious nuts out there br br the characters basically make no sense most of the time br br the film has no real beginning middle or ending nor is anything ever explained much br br the film opens with young man with the unlikely name of hazel motes apparently returning from stint in the army br br he hitches ride to two story house that is in extreme disrepair windows boarded over he goes in the house walks around and finally writes note that he leaves there this scene comes to nothing and we learn nothing further about the house or its history br br it is never explained exactly whose house this is or where the people have gone but we are given the impression hazel has probably lived there at one time br br hazel decides to go to city why we don know once he arrives in this city he writes down name address that he sees on bathroom wall and goes to visit this woman who is surprisingly fat hooker he sees her for awhile and then he apparently isn seeing her anymore like everything else in this movie it comes to nothing and serves no purpose br br young man named enoch tries to befriend him but hazel really isn interested although they keep crossing paths br br enoch is about as crazy as you can get one of his habits is to go to the zoo and stand in front of the cage where the chimps are and talk at them insultingly br br we never really know why enoch behaves as he does or why hazel behaves as he does beyond the fact hazel had an overdose of old time scary fundamentalist religion via his grandfather br br enoch later becomes enthralled with man who dresses in gorilla suit and manages to get the gorilla suit from him and then runs around in it br br hazel who is wound rather tight and seems to be in constant borderline rage does bit of street preaching got the impression he was trying to free himself from the untruths of the religion that had been drilled into him br br he has several encounters with preacher and his daughter although their interactions never really make any particular point and there is no plot line br br eventually hazel succumbs to complete religious fervor and begins self harming br br it is very odd film interesting in it oddness but other than that it has absolutely nothing going for it br br the cast does an outstanding job but this film completely fails to deliver either point of view or storyline br br the film also has the characters tossing around the word from time to time with no connection to the rest of the dialog br br 2 stars,0
I have no idea what the point of this film was supposed to be. It was so disjointed and confusing. I couldn't tell what was going on or what the characters were supposed to be doing. The acting was terrible and the dialogue was even worse. I would not recommend this film to anyone.,0
don watch soaps my grandmother still watches that one with the hour glass made fun of them it when was ten it was so easy br br but this movie takes parody and spells it new way found the story pretty damn funny the fashions of the 80 shoulder pads sequins and polyester just top it off the huge hair the high heels and the histrionics what combination br br and all the actors just go to town chewing up their parts and spitting them out in big well scripted pile sally kevin elisabeth wonderful whoopi great robert downey refreshing to see him back when he had such potential before the tabloids and garry why did we have to wait so long to see him on film leesa gibbons hadn been missing her but nice to include her as real life entertainment reporter and where do you apply for that job anyway br br admittedly could have done without sally climbing the drainpipe lucy ricardo did it how many times as has every comedienne from carol burnett to don know who and so done with it now could spit peanuts if had them apparently it what you do when you re being funny in tall building in new york just thankful they didn pull out the flagpole bit br br but it was cute it was funny it had plot twists it had an after credits ending before that was common it had clothes worthy of second glance it had great cast and it got personal memories for me really what more do you need,1
this film provides us with an interesting reminder of how easy it is for so many to get caught up in the busy occupation of doing nothing we as people of african descent owe it to ourselves to make change to this cycle of all talk and no action and start to realise in order to make change there needs to be less talk and more action it is powerful statement of the divisions of our people over small issues and our failings to recognise the bigger picture and the need to unite in order to make difference despite its reference to the black community all viewers can learn something from the message this film seeks to portray,1
after seeing forever hollywood it would be natural to want to see john waters film at least one get to say that they have joined the legions of cinema cognoscenti who have experienced the unique cinematic stylings of perhaps the best known non mainstream director it worth the effort and pf is lot better than eraserhead and there is certain campiness about his films which his followers find addicting,1
have seen this film three times now and each time see it it becomes more personal and more emotional to watch br br the acting is amazing which is not hard to believe since it is daniel day lewis who is an amazing actor brenda fricker is the surprise wonder in it though she captures your heart as the mother of physically disabled boy who is not able to walk or speak until he is in his late teens br br can say enough good things about the movie but will stop here recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies that are based on actual events or just enjoy good dramas in general,1
this movie is the best horror movie have ever seen the acting is terrible and the plot leaves lot to be desired but the puppet gave me nightmares for weeks seriously if you have little kids don let them see this of course am little biased because of an irrational fear of puppets and midgets also body double cameo by the guy who does mini me verne troyer and some gratuitous nudity must in any low budget horror movie all other horror movies will forever be judged against this in my book,0
hmmm started well like hybrid of files first wave unfortunately if the mere notion of da vinci lost time machine is preposterous to you then the final battle between one man with pistol and 4 16th century monks armed to the teeth with automatic weapons will seem positively ridiculous equalled only by poor acting poor script and screenplay or in other words giggle factor 5 captain,0
one of the worst movies ve ever seen when was trying to watch this had flu and was pretty open minded for any brainless entertainment unfortunately this was too much how so many totally ungifted actors can be in one movie this movie makes porn look like european art movie cast just speaks out their lines without any emotions special thanks to charlie snows baldwin soon to be ex wife who talks about her divorce like the rest of us talk about the weather just horrible and funny br br with lots of booze and friends this might just make it as background entertainment and few laughs just like ed wood movies the plot is joke and soundtrack straight from some cheeky soap opera br br hopefully nobody paid to see this movie br br,0
having the in laws over for the weekend then this is the film to hasten their departure failing that it will induce catatonic state to bring welcome relief from constant nagging br br the film is supposedly set on board luxury cruise ship which is more superannuated car ferry the plot has more holes than the average colander and cast dredged from the depths of the celebrity list an interesting piece of added amusement is playing spot the villain as passengers join the ship you won be wrong with script that sinks faster than brick clich√©d set pieces and copious amounts of raspberry jam doubling as blood this film attempts to encompass the genres of thriller action movie and gore fest and simultaneously fails to fulfil any of them br br must watch film if only to laugh at how bad it is,0
the ghost walks is nifty little mystery with great twist snappy dialog and best of all pansy played to the twittery hilt by character actor johnny arthur which never demeans or denigrates his character mr arthur is great in his role of homer erskine bringing great comic relief as the secretary of the broadway producer herman wood played by another great character actor richard carle br br they play off of each other superbly br br although the acceptable words of the time sissy and cream puff are used to describe the character of homer it is never mean spirited or meant as denigration and are not spoken by the manly males of the film but by his employer who fires and rehires him every other scene and who displays an almost exasperated affection for his devoted employee br br there is great scene where homer tells his boss that he has devoted the best years of his life to him and has been everything but mother to him br br the mystery angle of the film is very entertaining and the twist at the end might just leave you in stitches br br for low budget poverty row picture this film has superb set decoration and great costuming br br director frank strayer ably handles his cast and this film holds together much better than some of his other low budget mystery attempts but he had great script to work with and some wonderful actors to carry it through br br this film is must see for devotees of poverty row films old dark house mysteries they actually managed to work in the lines it was dark and stormy night and it has the added bonus of being an early representation of gay character in film where nothing bad happens to them in the end br br this movie is available for download in the public domain film section of the internet archive at archive org,1
did sandra yes she must have know we would still be here for her some nine years later br br see it if you haven again if you have see her live while you can,1
corridors of time the movie you can watch if you re looking for sophisticated way of suicide some use guns ropes or gas but you want to ruin your brains do not wait any longer corridors of time is probably one of the biggest possible mistakes thinking christian clavier is able to act and to bring you fun do not miss the 45 francs this poor thing cost me sometimes one has to reset its evaluation system looking at the absolute zero this film deserves 2 10 but that only because like jean reno too bad for him he also stars in ronin think gonna dislike him,0
thought the movie was ok but very disappointed that they don capture the true image of his life was so anticipating to see his mother being an actual jamaican that it driving me crazy just watching the beginning of the movie told me that the movie was not accurate which completely lost interest just matter of seconds from the beginning of the movie very disappointed that like watching biography story on mark anthony and having arnold play the part don know what the writer was thinking missing valuable piece of the movie which sure his mother played huge role in his life will say the movie was ok besides the major fla,0
sorry for jean after having such good original movie to be followed up by perhaps his worst movie in is career this movie was shot down terribly by horrible acting jobs by goldbeg romeo and whatever that computers name was also some scenes may have been just little unnesicary truly bad movie,0
have looked forward to seeing this since first saw it listed in her work finally found it yesterday 2 13 02 on lifetime movie channel br br jim larson comments about it being sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths were dead on writers probably shouldn get bonus everyone else sro for making the movie br br anybody who appreciates romantic movie should see it br br natasha screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric to say nothing of her beauty that anything she is in goes on my favorite list her tv and print interviews that have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking for br br god bless her her family and future endeavors br br this movie doesn seem to available in dvd or video yet but would be the first to buy it and think others would too,1
this film is fine example of why the shaw brothers are among the finest directors probably the best in the kung fu category the movie is well paced the story is excellent and intriguing and while the humor may not be in your face it is nested within the character interactions once the story builds up and the characters begin to assess the situation does the whole tower come crashing down in one of the best fight scenes tiger crane and crab hung gar are very present there is even scene that mocks 18th century western social events and ends with clever and entertaining fighting the movie ends with sudden cheesy moment but if you are fan of the shaw brothers you ll understand that the cheese is just topping and not the main course of the movie,1
to call movie like thinner bad is like calling the earth round or pauly shore un talented no news but how they got that way is what people want to know br br as far as this movie the book was good even if it was little derivative of other stories from the be careful what you wish for genre burke plays an overweight lawyer who kills the daughter of gypsy and is cursed by her father constantine from tv room 222 to several pounds day br br like said it starts out good but why involve the mobster mantegna why fire automatic weapons so much why turn it into something so heavily dependent on fx thought it would have been much more effective if it focused more on the subtle ramifications of weight loss crazes diseases death gypsy lore and such br br but no it not to be remember this is stephen king we re talking about br br and the ending almost the same as the book but little too talky in fact the whole movie talks too much feeling it has to explain every plot turn to us not that expected the dead zone but could have done without another pet sematary thanks anyway br br one star for at least trying to do halfway decent makeup job however the rest of the movie is left to be say it with me thinner,0
the pilot of enterprise has one thing that has been lacking since the original star trek dose of realistic flawed personalities the utopian characters of the next generation got tiring they were so noble as to be unbelievable also like the sub plot that humans are bitter toward the vulcans its funny seeing them as pretentious snobs it makes me look forward to seeing when the humans become the dominant race between the two though don think it would work in the time frame of the show the only negatives that jumped out at me were the quick cut off the ending at 2 hours feel of the end which is common among many of the trek shows the second was the shameless dig for ratings by couple of senselessly sexy scenes it was out of place good science fiction show should be able to stand on its own without trying to pad the pre teen audience with some skin but its not my job to make the show profitable so oh well br br lets see how the next episode does,1
rented this movie the other night because neither my girlfriend or myself had ever seen it even though we had heard from mutual friend how great it was br br now am pretty conservative in my views but knew going in it would be pretty liberal given who directed it figured before the movie started michael douglas would play compassionate popular liberal beloved by the masses and there would be stodgy conservative opponent as his antagonist but thought thats where the political statement would begin and end br br ok the plot was solid single president falls for lobbyist ok this has potential thought to be pretty entertaining since the plot was unique but then the movie turned into liberal infomercial the movie became more about gun control and environmental issues than it did about the relationship between the president and sydney annette bening br br there were several ridiculous premises in this movie 1 the character sydney playing this six figure lobbyist who is closer could she have been more flighty she was constantly disorganized and seemed in awe of everything hardly closer am an sales and she could not close selling glass of water to man dying of thirst br br 2 secondly is there anything more ridiculous than richard dreyfuss playing right wing fanatic this is the most liberal man in hollywood and her is playing some right wing ideologue give me break liked how he took his conservative character and made him as sinister as possible br br 3 the speech at the end was simply ludicrous the line about am proud card carrying member of the aclu was joke first no president would ever admit something like that being an active member of an ultra fringe group second why even bring something like that up you just alienated off over half the movie going audience who is moderate or conservative br br thought the plot was great and unique thought michael douglas was good choice as president but the movie went from being movie to left wing political statement which is why the movie failed br br its shame to see great plot ruined by hollywood having to force their political views on the audience,0
doesn this seem somewhat familiar oh wait that right 90 of the jokes in this movie have already been done in the tv series what the point in repeating yourself you may ask is it for the benefit of the americans who haven seen the programme did the scriptwriters run out of inspiration or maybe everyone on set suffered sudden attack of amnesia and forgot they covered this ground already either way for someone who has sat through the first three series this was just really boring had to turn it off during the tablets that turn your water green part yes it is very funny but give us something original for goodness sake actually if the best new stuff you can come up with is leonard rossiter take on saturday night fever you can forget it br br the guy they got to replace the late richard beckinsale is lookalike alright but not half the actor personally would exorcised the role as mark of respect to him or better yet not bothered making the film at all and just let the hilarity of the tv series speak for itself but no they couldn do that not as long as there was money to be made sad really 4 10,0
br br so not being poet myself have no real way to convey the beauty and simplicity of this documentary the effortless motion of goldsworthy as he molds natures beauty into his own work is captivating watch him stick reeds together in web hanging from tree in close up for few minutes while he speaks of his work and then receive the payoff when the camera cuts to the wide shot be amazed by the ease with which he operates and then realize the futility when slight breeze knocks down the entire web br br the genius of goldsworthy seemingly knows no bounds as his inspiration is nature itself it is in the essential change of nature where his work though complete in its own sphere is made whole,1
seriously this film is not steve guttenburg is constantly forcing his tough guy dialogue and then giving everyone the evil eye all the time he just wasn believable he seems like he trying to be badass and he sucks at it just remember him as the millionaire dad with the olsen twins in it takes two so this is big change rented this film for sean bean and he dies as usual only this time he didn get impaled on boat anchor patriot games smashed by giant satellite dish goldeneye or get run over by cows the field he just got shot real quick like and civil and that was all got from this film that they didn kill him off in an extremely grotesque and morbid way how sad is that was only watching it for the 3 seconds that sean was in it and then the rest was rubbish actually tried to watch and understand the plot but there really wasn one seemed little like mission impossible with the hole oooooo there mole it the leader of the group and no one expected it let trap him let frame the underdog good guy so we can get away with it cliched and tired this movie was waste of time,0
in famous essay he wrote about charles dickens george orwell points out that many readers always regretted that dickens never continued writing like he did in pickwick papers that is he did not stick to writing funny episodic novels for the rest of his career this would not have been too difficult for dickens his contemporary robert surtees did precisely that only concentrating on the misadventures of the fox hunting set mr fancy romford hounds is title of one of his novels among hunters and horse lovers surtees still has following but most people find his novels unreadable dickens was determined to show he was more than funny man and don forget his first book sketches by boz was also funny book so dickens third book is oliver twist which got pretty grim at points orwell says that for any author to grow they have to change the style of their books dickens would definitely and successfully have agreed to that br br but orwell overlooked the genre writer who transcends his fellows surtees as said is genre writer concentrating on hunting but not everyone is interested in hunting but wodehouse saw himself as an entertainer poking fun at the upper reaches of the british social system his earl of emsworth is prouder of raising the finest pig in england than being well earl of emsworth his psmith is always prepared to counterattack when he is supposed to be submissive to an unfair superior his stanley uckridge will always have perfect scheme that should net huge profit but always manages to come apart at the end and best of all his jeeves will always put his brilliant brain to work rescuing the inept bertie wooster his boss since wodehouse had limited view of his mission as writer he was there to do cartoon figures of fun for the entertainment of the world his books never lost their glow they served and still serve their purposes in fact compared wodehouse with his far more serious contemporary evelyn waugh who also wrote funny books but of more intellectual type the best of waugh remains among the high points of 20th century british literature brideshead revisited decline and fall and the rest but in his determination to make his points if his points failed to interest the reader the book frequently collapsed for every vile bodies there was some failure late in his career like the ordeal of gilbert pinfold while wodehouse could do lesser hack work too his falling did not go as far as waugh did br br wodehouse also was gifted lyricist when you hear bill in the score of showboat it is not kern and hammerstein tune but kern and wodehouse tune transposed from oh lady lady dozen years earlier he was handy dramatist too so it is pleasing to see that he took his novel damsel in distress and turned it into the screenplay here br br it has the normal wodehouse touches that perfect butler keggs reginald gardiner in wonderful performance is scoundrel in rigging friendly gambling game of chance among the staff of the stately home he heads he is also unable to refrain occasionally from singing italian opera despite constance collier attempts to control his impulse this is typical wodehouse characterization so is the way the love affair between lady alyce and jerry keeps going well and going down due to the antics of keggs and young albert both of whom want to win that game of chance pot of cash wodehouse always does that type of plot switch with antagonists switching their point of view depending on their present state of interest br br wodehouse was also lucky here to have burns and allan to work with it is generally considered that of all the films they made as supporting actors together such as six of kind and we re not dressing george and gracie did their best support with fred astaire the fun house sequence which includes the song stiff upper lip is wonderful as is an earlier sequence where the three do whisk broom dance that astaire learned from burns but gracie marvelous illogical logic is used by wodehouse in scenes with gardiner see how she manages to confuse him into giving her more money than her change deserves to be only albert happens to notice keggs gardiner mistake and looks at gardiner as though he either stupid or mad her dialog with lady caroline collier son reggie ray noble the british band leader leading him to imagine that he will marry her but saying goodbye to gracie as she drives off with george to get married is wonderful too br br the film supposedly failed at the box office because of the lack of ginger rogers in it and the weakness of joan fontaine fontaine is not doing remarkable job in the role but the flaw is really wodehouse he don make the character very interesting but the film can stand without that given the other performers and their characters gershwin music and wodehouse marvelous sense of fun,1
in 1987 john hughes wrote and directed planes trains and automobiles which was hilarious and poignant comedy the best thing he ever done ten years on he reduced to again recycling the plot of home alone in this second sequel which is not connected to the other films but is equally uninspired and sadistic the four crooks that right four and one of them is girl congratulations hughes for introducing this revolutionary change to the series are electrocuted with metal chairs brained with barbells and blinded with paint ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha while the new kid is even less charming than culkin you think that the departure of almost all the key players from the first two films would stop hughes from fossilising the same old routines but the only surprise is that not even he turned up for home alone 4,0
consider myself huge horror movie fan one night wanted to just rent some newer horror movies to make fun of then rented milo was so surprised by this movie it scared the hell outta me that not something can say very often usually halloween only scares me br br two other friends watched it with me and were left with disturbed feeling good feeling if you ask me after watching horror movie if you are unaffected then what the point br br this movie was original it follow the normal guidelines of horror movie that why movies like valentine bombed for me br br of course many are left with unanswered questions as most horror movies do it is worth the rent though,1
was never big fan of horror movies they usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children they usually lack originality and contain overacting galore the only horror movie like was stir of echoes with kevin bacon it was well acted and had great story but it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by stanley kubrick the shining quite possibly the scariest movie ever br br the movie follows writer jack nicholson and his family who agree to watch over hotel while it is closed for the winter there were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family but jack is convinced it will be ok and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer block after months of solitude and silence however jack becomes grumpy and later violent is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad br br one of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that kubrick makes the hotel is very silent and the rooms are huge yet always empty it is also eerily calm when jack son is riding his bike through the barren hallways jack nicholson performance is also one of his very best scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile my favorite scene is when he is talking to ghost from inside walk in refrigerator br br the shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion beating the snot out of crap like the ring and the blair witch project it may be oldie but is definitely goodie 8 10,1
have vague memories of this movie being funny br br having seen it again either have changed or was thinking about another film altogether br br it seems as if we are supposed to be sympathetic to jackie mason character however nothing in the movie actually engenders that emotion its notable that he is really the only person accorded tender dialogue with loved ones no one else character is allowed to rise to the status of even vaguely human br br don even like golf but as the film went on found myself really rooting for robart stack and the club guys really hoping they would repel mason and chevy chase,0
this movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason definitely not well made movie so unbelievable the scenes where the president holbrook were downtown and walking among the people were farce there would not be chance for the common folk to be within 30 yards of the president in that situation in real life if it for the blood and profanity this was shot like tv movie it could have been decent if it was done differently holbrook president talents were never realized in this movie shatner acting is okay the production values in this movie leave lot to be desired overall think most people would be better off not wasting time to watch this affair,0
in the funeral of the famous british journalist joe strombel ian mcshane his colleagues and friends recall how obstinate he was while seeking for scoop meanwhile the deceased joe discloses the identity of the tarot card serial killer of london he cheats the reaper and appears to the american student of journalism sondra pransky scarlett johansson who is on the stage in the middle of magic show of the magician sidney waterman woody allen in london and tells her that the murderer is the aristocrat peter lyman hugh jackman sondra drags sid in her investigation seeking for evidences that peter is the killer however she falls in love with him and questions if joe strombel is right in his scoop br br scoop is another great woody allen comedy outside manhattan actually again in london his ironic and witty lines are simply fantastic and laughed lot inclusive with his fate of hero in country where people drive in the wrong side sid waterman is extremely funny and woody allen is in an excellent shape as comedian however his present muse scarlett johansson of whom am big fan has over acting and is annoying in many moments changing inclusive her accent to histrionic pronunciation her character is absolutely silly and promiscuous and was quite disappointed with her performance probably for the first time in her filmography but this supernatural comedy is still hilarious and worthwhile entertainment my vote is eight br br title brazil scoop grande furo scoop the big scoop,1
saw this again recently on comedy central love to see jean schertler memama and emmy collins hippie in supermarket cast as mother and son in film it would probably be the weirdest flicker ever made hats off to waters for making consistently funny film,1
yes give it 10 because compare it not only to others of it kind but also to the dreck one is bombarded with on daily basis in what laughably called today popular culture that aside the film is beautifully cast as has been stated elsewhere and gives us fairly good look at popular theater of the late 18th and early 20th centuries no small coincidence is that many of the plays that olcott played in involved similar plot boy meets girl someone objects usually the father or some authority figure boy struggles boy wins girl the was actually known at the time as chauncey olcott act no coincidence too that john ford directed one he called it the quiet man and my wild irish rose is in itself chauncey olcott act great stuff no anyway great songs great stuff enjoy br br ps after seeing the film like to know more about bill scanlan found an obit that said he quit mauvorneen as result of insanity replaced as in the film by chauncey olcott and died in an asylum several years later but he had been apparenlty very big star in his own right who wrote songs and plays and had plays written for him br br anyone know more,1
anastasia the mystery of anna was two part star studded historical movie based on the peter kurth book anastasia the riddle of anna anderson it keeps up historically pretty much names are changed etc but sticks to the real story quite well omar sharif and claire bloom do quite well as the russian royals czar nicholas and czarina alexandra what stuck out in my mind was the all too short portrayals by rex harrison and olivia de havilland all in all it was pretty classy production with some fine acting was quite awestruck by the production values when it first aired on nbc in late 1986 also starring was the fine german actor jan niklas who had previously starred in nbc other russian epic peter the great br br felt that part 2 skipped over some important details of anna anderson trip to america it important to know too that in 1986 less was known about the anna anderson story back then it was still not known whether her claim to be the grand duchess anastasia was genuine by the late 1990 more was known and anna anderson is now reputed to have been fraud br br too bad the networks aren making fine made for television movies like this anymore,1
you think you re in for some serious sightseeing when the premise of the movie takes place primarily between two characters as they travel 3000 miles or so from france to saudi arabia going through most of europe italy bulgaria croatia slovenia turkey before arriving in the middle east but this is not tour and there are no stopovers for soaking in the sights br br reda father is in his twilight years and wishes to do the haj however since walking and taking the mule is out of the question he chooses to travel to mecca by car he can drive and therefore enlists the help of reda to his son protest to get him there in their broken down vehicle br br but reda doesn see the point of having him go along when his dad could opt for the plane he resents the idea of having put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he couldn understand and hence we set off in this arduous journey with father and son being not the best of pals br br the beauty of this movie is to witness the development of the father and son pair the challenges they face the weird people they meet having to duke it out in varied weather conditions and alternating rest stops between motels and sleeping in the car we see an obvious generation gap in them trying to communicate to each other the father trying to impose on his son and the son trying to assert himself as an adult but circumstances we see reveal that reda is quite fish out of water through the many encounters they actually team up quite well despite their differences br br it perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to coincide with hari raya haji and having the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their haj the final scene in mecca is truly sight to behold and you too would feel the claustrophobia and fear as reda tries to hunt down his dad amongst the thousands of people congregating the sights of europe were perhaps deliberately not dwelled upon so as to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destination br br it certainly rang home the thought of telling and showing loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are don miss this and yes book early was pleasantly surprised that this evening session was still full house,1
everyone is entitled to an opinion the only critic who counts is yourself think this is great movie much better than the original br br in caddyshack rodney dangerfield is funny but obnoxious he was asked to do the sequel but things got in the way jackie mason shows the saying that less is more he is funny but man with real family issues more rounded person it no drama but movie that makes you feel actually in some points you feel sorry for jackie mason especially when his daughter walks out on him br br it has good soundtrack and overall good sorry good end to the series br br in the tv show alf alf says that he cried in terms of endearment the wife kate tanner played by anne schedeen also says he cried at caddyshack 2,1
glad they finally released it on dvd bought the video tape years ago and watch it at least once or twice year br br grammer has wry wit about him that really makes this movie success its formula is certainly not original but it very funny nonetheless am very surprised that it didn receive higher in the ratings br br it ranks as one of my all time favorite comedies it just fun little flick that makes you feel good and sometimes that all movie is meant to be,1
as youth pastor heard good things about this movie then watched it the acting wasn the best that forgivable it the message that not give jesus your life and everything will change you ll tackle better make amazing catches stop fumbling start making touchdown passes and even make the playoffs all because jesus magically turns horrible undersized weaklings into all american athletes laughed out loud when coach quoted scripture to explain to the kicker why he was missing field goals but wait that not all you ll get brand new truck 6000 raise and you and your wife struggle with infertility will suddenly end in pregnancy twice then you ll win the state championship because god helps weakling kick the winning field goal 12 yards further than he ever kicked before and into the wind no less all because god wanted him to make it then you ll win the state championship again the next year none of this good stuff would have happened if the team hadn chosen to follow jesus will all their hearts br br here what took away from the movie god can do anything he wants to do whenever he wants to do it and it all about making our lives better easier and more enjoyable he chooses his favorite team and helps them win games which bible is this story based on ll bet saint stephen wished he known the keys to such safe life before he was stoned to death someone should have made this movie before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed for following jesus it would have saved them all lot of trouble,0
the last person who dies before new years is cursed to drive the phantom carriage for whole year picking up the souls of the dead br br saw scene from this old silent swedish horror film on youtube and decided to track down the whole movie it was well worth the work finding it because it an absolutely amazing movie for the time it was made it has wonderfully eerie atmosphere the old time horror film makers really knew how to create the perfect atmosphere sadly many of today film makers don seem to understand how important setting and atmosphere are and go for the cheap jump scares the visual effects are excellent considering its date of production if you can find copy of this highly recommend giving it watch 9 10,1
bill crain rarer than rare slasher movie certainly doesn follow the standard stalk and slash guidelines that have become so essential of its counterparts the bogeyman this time around uses grenades and small arms as well as an awesome array of melee weapons sin that virtually unacceptable in most post halloween genre pieces but there still just enough familiarity to keep slasher buffs from checking the rule book and the plot never strays too far from the path that you ve grown to expect just as wally koz surprisingly decent 555 was seemingly put together with help from various members of his family mirage seems to have been joint production from relatives of the director looking through the credits noticed numerous crains listed in key positions throughout the construction of the feature but despite fairly good distribution across the globe the movie failed to make an impression either side of the atlantic and now it has become pretty much phantom of the vhs market nevertheless this only made it appeal to me even more and so strained my resources to track copy down br br it all takes place in the middle of the dessert which as sure you ll agree is hardly the most exciting location with that said though must admit that there certainly going to be no chance of any nosey john laws turning up unexpectedly four undeniably beautiful youngsters head out into the sand for night of debauchery and frolics that always seems to rub homicidal maniacs the wrong way chris jennifer mcallister and her boyfriend greg kenny johnson meet up with amusing new age hippies trip kevin mcparland and mary nicole anton at make shift camp site in the midst of the dune like wilderness greg older brother kyle todd schaefer and his buxom girlfriend bambi laura albert soon turn up to join the body count applicants in their quest for an early grave kyle used to date chris before his younger brother took the liberty of stealing his squeeze something that kyle doesn seem too keen to forget sound like motive for massacre well what did you expect before long an unseen someone driving truck with tinted windows joins the gathering with unique set of tricks up his sleeve will any of the kids survive to turn up for sequel br br have had trouble tracking down any information at all about this feature don even know if director bill crain is aka william crain the man behind midnight fear and blacula among others mirage certainly doesn appear on his official filmography so your guess is as good as mine judging by the credible work behind the camera have to say that find it hard to believe that this is the debut of man with no previous cinematic experience the film is stylishly photographed with some superb work from dp michael crain and the director boasts credible talent for building suspense when it necessary christopher biggs gore fx are imaginatively created and gruesome and kudos to the sleepy head over at the bbfc who inexplicably let this pass through uncut on usually stringent 18 rating couple of the murders are indeed extremely macabre one guy gets buried up to his neck in sand before coming face to face with grenade while another ends up literally legless after loosing battle with chain and pick up truck there also some black humor that surely unintentional we spend the majority of the feature seeing only the killer boots as he steps out of his vehicle and stalks the youngsters but when he revealed to hilariously resemble keanu reeves circa bill and ted bogus journey didn quite know what to expect thankfully crain knows exactly how to keep things creepy and the showdown is particularly mean spirited as the psycho taunts chris sadistically br br there are some surprisingly good performances on display from an extremely inexperienced cast the divine jennifer mcallister does superb job as the heroine and steers portrays off his rocker dementia with finesse the casting director chose wisely to pick some of the most beautiful females ever slaughtered in slasher cinema and it gratefully doesn come at the cost of thespian potential the soundtrack works well to build the desolate atmosphere of isolation which is carefully handled by director that should have been signed and nurtured by hollywood bigwigs watch out for the superb nightmare sequence that is truly horror film making at it freakiest br br mirage is good late entry to the cycle that was somewhat unfortunate to miss boom year placing amongst the slasher elite when you consider that this was made with just cast of seven and pick up truck you have to say that they did damn good job the flaws are numerous but never detract credibility from the net result unfortunately you ve probably got more chance of finding liquid gold in your coffee mug than you have of ever tracking down copy if you see this one covered in dust on the top shelf of your local video store then make sure you pick it up recommended,1
loved this movie knew it would be chocked full of camp and silliness like the original series found it very heart warming to see adam west burt ward frank gorshin and julie newmar all back together once again anyone who loved the batman series from the 60 should have enjoyed return to the batcave you could tell the actors had lot of fun making this film especially adam west and ll bet he would have gladly jumped back into his batman costume had the script required him to do so told number of friends about this movie who chose not to view it now they wished they had have all of the original 120 episodes on vhs now this movie will join my collection thank you for the reunion adam and burt,1
put this movie on not expecting much other than movie gore fest thankfully was presented with very well made film that built up the suspense and managed to maintain it throughout its run time this was an impressive achievement the acting was solid creating characters that you cared about and related to and although some may find the film slow it did force you to think about what you would have done in the same situation added to this there was some fine camera work and the directors pulled it all together admirably an excellent effort then that is well worth your time if you prefer development and suspense over gore,1
having seen only once and in the dawn hours can seem to forget this haunting film mix of mystery suspense and heartbreaking romance it reminds me of vertigo the actors though not that well known are good especially joan hackett in one of her best performances you believe in her in her love in her newfound quest for freedom brought by her love and in the end in her overwhelming pain the plot is ingenious and compelling and does not stretch credibility the direction and technical stuff certainly could be better but they do not compromise the overall effect and it has one message don let revenge blind you you can became its last victim real pity it has not been remade but perhaps it is period piece better left alone,1
un gatto nel cervello or nightmare concert as it more commonly know amongst english speaking audiences starts as horror film director lucio fulci played by the man himself lucio fulci goes to lunch after filming very gory violent scene however he orders steak has horrible vision relating to cannibalism the grotesque visions hallucinations dreams continue begin to affect his mental state fulci decides to seek help contacts professor egon schwarz dvid thompson for psychiatric help schwarz claims that fulci cannot separate fantasy from reality agrees to help him however schwarz has more sinister ulterior motive as serial killer starts to brutally kill prostitutes fulci thinks he might be responsible br br this italian production was co written directed by lucio fulci who also stars in the film as horror film director named lucio fulci which doesn really feel like lot of effort went into it anyway un gatto nel cervello is gory if nothing else for that alone rather liked it the script by fulci john fitzsimmons giovanni simonelli antonio tentori is nothing more than threadbare excuse to edit together lots of gory footage from other italian films it serves it purpose well enough suppose to see fulci on screen has certain fascination if your fan of his or are familiar with his films the ending is very rushed almost as if they ran out of money as it just has policeman telling fulci they killed the killer that it another thing about that ending when the two cops put the white sheet over the dead killer in the field then they walk away leaving it there without any other police presence mean would the police in italy just leave dead body in the middle of field on it own it moves along at good pace if you like your gore then you have to see this although if you don like gore then you ll hate it with passion it all depends on your disposition so the choice folks is yours br br director fulci was never the most artistically adept filmmaker it shows here as his footage is bland flat looks like it was shot for tv the footage from the other films 7 in total doesn match the stuff fulci shot it is obvious that this has been pieced together from different films if your looking for gore you ve hit the jackpot people are dismembered with chainsaws put through meat grinders faces are melted there are few decapitations there are some slit throats someones body is gorily crushed under car tongue is ripped out someone has their throat crushed as wheelchair runs over it there are loads of stabbings someone has their guts removed with hook there rotten corpse complete with maggots someone hand is cut off someone has their head bashed in their eye falls out gory death by piano wire as it slices through someones throat there are loads of severed limbs gallons of blood splashed around scene of some cats eating brains there more as well having said that some of the special effects are bit fake look cheesy br br with supposed budget of around 100 000 it shows this is pretty cheap looking it has no visual style or artistic merit but then again why would you want those when you can see nazi orgy sequence wall to wall gore the acting in this is terrible including fulci br br un gatto nel cervello is top film if your gore hound like me however if your looking for something with little bit more substance or indeed any substance then this ones not for you this is the sort of film which divides people straight down the middle you ll either love what it does or hate it,1
ok so it owes pulp fiction but in my opinion has it own voice and identity mainly because of the music video direction style sketch like narrative and great performances thomas jane delivers great the drug dealer show down is extraordinary aaron eckhart likewise james legros has short and effervescent appearance great humor they got the wong house the porzikova interrogation and rape scene is memorable as is mickey rourke cameo appearance take peak br br great hollywood popcorn production with strong performances of level aspirants and renegades rourke br br well take peak it worth,1
this is my all time favorite fred astaire and ginger rogers film the dialogue between the two is so cute and funny and very clever not to mention this film contains some of the best songs recorded by the two like putting all my eggs in one basket and let face the music and dance if remember correctly this was the film that introduced me to fred astaire so suppose because of that it will always hold special place in my heart sorry for the sentimental cr but woman so get over it all in all this film gets an 8 10 from me the choreography was superb and also the fact that lucille ball is in it makes it even more awesome,1
written by someone who has been there you can tell but only if you ve been there excellent performances by meryl streep of course renee zellweger and william hurt br br many people have said that it is about dysfunctional family think every family is dysfunctional when they are facing this kind of torment to not be dysfunctional would be dysfunctional you are losing your family as you know it can anything be worse people need to see this movie so when they are faced with this nightmare maybe they will change how they do it maybe they will see that the father is denying himself valuable time he ll never get chance at again maybe they will realize how hard it is to die or to watch someone you love die they didn miss much of the nightmare it hard to forget,1
8 2008 when originally wrote my comments shortly after first seeing this film took critical view feeling that lemmon and matthau had basically phoned in their performances which paired them in manner they done several times previously br br but upon seeing it again it seemed different especially in view that neither of the two main mega stars lived great deal longer after its release br br with the exception of spiner all of the eight principals are performers with considerable experience and likewise unavoidably lot longer in tooth than we ve seen in many of their other film and work but isn almost everyone br br seeing it again while it certainly won be regarded as classis in any of their careers it is fun film with lot of interesting scenery as well br br from my viewpoint it reminds me that many films plays etc can often be looked at either from very critical viewpoint or looking instead to the lighter side without expecting film to be another citizen kane casablance or in terms of the two leads another original odd couple it also will provide continuing piece of nostalgia for lemmon and matthau as well as the others in the cast,1
nb spoilers within this great movie is about so many things all of them successfully sci fi time travel unstable psychologies dystopian society the what is real syndrome gradual undermining of belief systems worldwide bioterrorism and nascent love story br br the ramifications of the story twisted time line stir up loads of heated debate witness the discussions within this site or as an extreme check out the dissertation at www mjyoung net time monkeys html whew such temporal emphasis speaks mostly to the brilliant plot coming from the magnificent work of writers david and janet peoples not to mention the inspiration of chris marker la jetee without doubt this is one of the most successful fascinating time travel movies ever conceived but there are many other levels speaking here br br the movie real genius is to focus on the nasty side effects of time travel in the mind of james cole bruce willis doing the best work of his career here his journey progresses from gung ho vaccine hunting warrior to gradually unhinged victim and back again the other broad sweep of the story increasingly emphasizes the personal tale between james and dr kathryn railly the wonderful madeleine stowe love the simultaneous shifting opposing viewpoints of these two characters for me it all comes to head in the fleabag hotel room scene by this point james once gripped by an unshakable determination now slumps in utter doubt about his own reality while dr railly the cool and rational scientist has finally become wildly convinced after absorbing james proofs of his horrific predictions her desperation to get through to james and hang on to the mission shows how far she come br br gilliam makes us care about these characters especially through the crescendo of tension threading their lives the balance held between emotional roller coaster and mounting sci fi puzzle thriller is exquisite and the denouement at the airport is heart poundingly intense because we see it coming so clearly through james dreams it is here just after james has decided to quit the whole mess and is fighting his insanity more than ever that he steps back up to the plate and does what is necessary for mankind see jose and the gun just before this the references to hitchcock vertigo and identity switching confusion are brilliant this is movie to be hashed out between thinking people it not only holds up under repeated viewings it demands them twelve monkeys is intelligent provocative bizarre funny and suspenseful stuff br br the supporting cast is excellent especially brad pitt stealing all of his scenes and showing great flexibility as jeffery goines crazed and spoiled but ever the survivor and there is david morse as dr peters interesting how the movie simply leaves to the viewer his wicked motivation and christopher plummer as dr goines but the biggest accolades belong to terry gilliam surpassing here just barely his outstanding brazil lots of parallels of course especially the lonely combatant trying to escape his crumbling surroundings lunacy within lunacy without every frame of this movie has his unique stamp and tone the soundtrack is terrific too br br this is one of the great achievements of the 90s true favorite of mine and sure to hold up for long time to come,1
as an adult am grateful to have caught this movie by chance when was teen during the time was experiencing familial problems this particular movie managed to capture what was seeing from closeted world how much peer pressure is too much actually had to purchase this movie because it reached me on level unlike most films try to reach an audience how far might an individual go for social acceptance who is the bad crowd teenagers do struggle trying to find out the answers to these questions but ultimately who is the pack leader if there must be one is it the strong the beautiful perhaps the person we just all seem to like could it be the moral character as far as the movie goes the cast worked together as if it were predestined only hope that more directors and producers try to create piece of work that reaches all of us like this particular movie reached me wish could vote higher than ten because this particular title deserves much more,1
when many people say it the worst movie ve ever seen they tend to say that about virtually any movie they didn like however of the nearly 700 movies can remember ever seeing this one is one of two that walked away from feeling personally insulted and angry this is my first movie review by the way and registered with imdb just to rave at this movie badness went to see it when it was in the theaters myself and my two buddies were 3 of 5 people there and after 15 years can remember very many specifics but my attitude upon leaving the theater is still crystal clear br br spoiler alert br br oh my where to begin fat loser left at altar goes on ski weekend meets blonde bombshell who takes an interest in him takes him home to meet the family they re all cannibals and he the main course pathetic attempt at dramatic escape kicks all their butts and runs off with the brother girlfriend they live happily ever after puke firstly the gags are so bad that it took me while to understand that they were trying to be funny and that this was comedy the special effects what few there are look like they were done 15 years earlier the big dramatic ending was so hokey and poorly acted that it was nearly unbearable to watch he knocks out the entire cannibal family with rakes laying in the lawn that stand up tom and jerry style when they step on them sure that there much much more but have no intention on seeing it again for refresher,0
the warmest most engaging movie of its genre those lips those eyes made me smile and cry as it reminded me of the work it takes to pursue dream and the pain of disappointment hulce and langella are superb and the story seems to write itself brilliant screenplay by david shaber one of my favorites see the warriors and nighthawks for more and beautiful sets filmed on location think at the actual summer theater in which the story takes place you can see this movie and not want to drop everything and get into the theater please check this video out if you can find it,1
when rodney dangerfield is on roll he hilarious in my 5 wives he not on roll the timing of the one liners is off but they re the best thing going for the movie the five women who play the wives don add up to one whole actress between them the plot is very weak even the premise is pretty weak there are few jokes about having multiple wives but the situation has little to do with anything else in the movie most of the movie could play the same way even if rodney character had only one wife so the premise seems more like an old man fantasy than key part of the comedy another old man fantasy we re supposed to accept that rodney character is an athletic skier br br jerry stiller seems to be phoning in his role just to do buddy favor and the rest of the name actors must simply be desperate for work br br the odd nods to political correctness later in the movie don really do anything for the movie for those who like their movies politically correct the non pc humor is still there in the first place and the seeming apologies for it still don get the point for those who hate seeing movie cave in to political correctness the pc add ins are just annoying digressions br br this has to be the mildest rated movie ve ever seen there are some racy jokes and the bedroom scenes would have made shocking tv 40 years ago but that about it maybe it was the topless men kidding br br the dvd features interviews where the cast members seem to find depth and importance in this movie and in their roles kept wondering if they were serious or kidding they seem to be serious but kept thinking they must be kidding there also peculiar disclaimer suggesting that since the movie never actually names the mormons or the church of latter day saints that somehow it not about them never mind that the movie features polygamous religion in utah and makes reference to brigham young br br in short my 5 wives was disappointment was hoping for rodney on roll but the best can say for the movie is that rodney was looking pretty good for guy who was pushing 80 at the time,0
this movie certainly deserves to be placed within the genre of horror but not for obvious reasons the horror of tale of two sisters lies not with sudden shocks or large helpings of cgi guts and gore it is psychological horror movie which piques the viewer curiosity from the start and builds suspenseful aura of mystery and questions throughout best of all the ending does not provide clear answer pushing the viewer to analyse what they have seen and make up their own mind about what really took place br br do not be put off by the seemingly slow pace at which the movie begins and don expect to be jumping out of your seat immediately this is not the conventional hack and slash movie with orchestral stings designed to make you scared of nothing in particular tale of two sisters slowly builds an atmosphere of terror terror of the unknown and fear of things which evade explanation until the very end even when the final conclusion is revealed it is not so heavy handed and obvious as to make the entire film fall neatly into place the movie requires its viewer to reflect back on what they have seen and to try and square this with the frightening revelation of the final scene some things will still be open to interpretation and this is one of the joys of watching film such as this br br the true fear of tale of two sisters lies not in shocks or conspicuous scares it is psychological gut wrenching horror that defies convention and expands genre to proportions hitherto unexplored by the traditional horror film it is no exaggeration to say that this film stands apart even from the so called asian horror genre indeed it would be mistake to align tale of two sisters with films like ringu and the grudge this movie can be understood from variety of standpoints some requiring no suspension of credulity others embracing the supernatural wholeheartedly br br whichever way you choose to interpret this film it is one that demands an open minded approach rewarding viewers regardless of their preconceived notions on asian cinema or horror in general,1
ve been waiting for superhero movie like this for long time mystery men takes its place among the classic comic strip spoofs on tv like batman and captain nice and cartoons like underdog and super chicken the same spirit lives in all of them the comic tongue in cheek tone the courage to aim for the heroic in life at the risk of looking ridiculous the not so sure footed way that these characters manage to prevail over their adversaries it the misfired spark of nobility igniting in the weak and the ordinary and it wonderful to see it glow so high and bright here br br mystery men opens on party at nursing home wish kinka usher had had the sense to give more energy and life to the old people in the scene as it is it looks like something george romero might have devised we need to get the feeling that these old people are as sharp as everyone else or it feels patronizing by the time the red eyes crash the festivities you half expect tom waits who plays weapons inventor with penchant for ladies in their eighties to stand up and shout just what this party needs little excitement if writer neil cuthbert had any sense he would have had waits mixing it up with the intruders and egging on the partiers to do the same it would have made for rousing beginning and better introduction of the troublesome trio the shoveler william macy the blue raja hank azaria and mr furious ben stiller who seem to come out of nowhere to save the day br br there are many other problems to mystery men than care to go into among them that the villain casanova frankenstein needs to have as cultivated sense of the absurd as the rest of the people in this movie and he doesn geoffrey rush is the wrong actor for the part he needs to be way over the top to make the conflict between good and evil galvanic one and rush has never exhibited talent for the outre you hope for the ripe theatrics of john lithgow in the adventures of buckaroo banzai or the dry debonair diffidence of paul freeman in raiders of the lost ark instead what we get is pastiche something half baked and not fully realized br br there are too many ideas running through mystery men for anyone to tie them neatly together and that may be its deepest problem but whatever kind of mess it is is the kind of mess love ben stiller has always seemed to be slumming in the roles he takes this one is no exception but he goes at it with such conviction that you come away feeling that he learned something about comedy growing up in household run by jerry stiller and anne meara his roy is related to all the put upon overly sensitive chronically defensive types that woody allen made popular and whether it wheedling his way into the affections of the waitress at his favorite hangout the sleek claire forslani or questioning the wisdom of fellow superhero wes studi as the sphinx or giving new member of their elite group jeaneane garofalo in what are possibly her funniest moments on screen hard time he makes it always fun to watch couldn exactly say that about him in there something about mary br br jeaneane garofalo proves with this performance that she should have been the star of one true thing not renee zellweger don think have ever seen funnier exchanges between daughter and father okay so he dead and his skull is in bowling ball so sue me in the movies and the funny part about this role is that it feels like screwball reprise of emily watson spellbinding talks with god in breaking the waves and in this version the girl doesn die and bells don ring in your head br br william macy does something very difficult he makes stolid magnetic you understand right away what attracted jenifer lewis lucille to eddie you can also understand her exasperation the barbecue alone would be enough to drive me over the edge but when eddie adorable half breed son looks up at his father and says believe in you daddy to which lucille sighs and exclaims roland don encourage your father you feel like standing and hailing neil cuthbert as first rate wit br br with hank azaria whose only moment of note in film up to this point was his bare behind in the birdcage and louise lasser has it been more than two decades since we first took note of her in bananas and mary hartman mary hartman as son and mother who share fondness for silverware greg kinnear as captain amazing and ricky jay as his publicist kel mitchell as invisible boy paul reubens as the spleen and lena olin who if she didn have the few lines in this movie that she has would seem to be visiting the set,1
